# Boxel - Duet 3 Config
These are my personal Boxel config files. I use this repository to track my changes and to give a general idea of how to set up a tool changer using a Duet 3 and Toolboards.

RRF3 configuration files for the Motion System & ToolChanger.

My Hardware and firmware is:
````
Duet 3 MB6HC FIRMWARE_VERSION: 3.3 
Duet TOOL1LC FIRMWARE_VERSION: 3.3
Duet 3 Tool Distribution Board
````

**Warning My ports for connected hardware and setup will vary from yours.** -> See config.g in the upper part.

THIS REPOSITORY IS A CONSTANT DEVELOPMENT AND I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE FILES WORK FOR YOU. USE THEM WISELY.
